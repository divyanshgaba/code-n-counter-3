<b>Fall Detection Mechanism By Application of Piezo Tiles</b>

<p>According to the Home Safety Council an American Non-Profit Organization, falling in bathrooms 
is the leading cause of unintentional home injury deaths and around 6,000 lives are lost every year.
 The project is mainly centeralized on the problem faced by elderly people in our home. Many of the time they slip down 
 accidently in bathroom and due to age factor and fragile body they are unable to get back up and open the door of washroom.
 This might lead to seviour injury and even death. We aim to prevent such activites by application of our project in which we are detecting any fall inside our area of deployment of piezo tiles. </p>
